<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Human mobility patterns are significantly influenced by home location. While extensive research has focused on specific aspects ---such as distance decay of interaction, home-centered activity space, or nested urban system structure --- universal mobility characteristics that generalize these classic theories of movement remain largely unexplored. Here, we partition individual daily mobility trajectories into modules and analyze their spatial extent relative to the home location. We find a universal inflation law that the module radius increases sublinearly with distance from home, consistent across three orders of magnitude and unaffected by demographic factors. By comparing modules to the hierarchical level in which they are located, we reveal that modules farther away from home correspond to higher levels in a urban hierarchical system. These findings deepen our understanding of human mobility dynamics and demonstrate the profound connection between classical urban theory, human geography, and mobility studies.</p>
